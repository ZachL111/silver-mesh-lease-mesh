# Field Notes

The useful part of this repository is the small rule set around quorum health and replica lag.

The domain cases cover `quorum health`, `lease drift`, `replica lag`, and `membership churn`. They sit beside the smaller starter fixture so the project has both a compact scoring check and a domain-flavored review check.

`stress` is the strongest case at 168 on `lease drift`. `baseline` is the cautious anchor at 100 on `quorum health`.

The language-specific addition keeps the review model as queryable sqlite views and assertions.
